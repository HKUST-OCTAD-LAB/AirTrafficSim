# AirTrafficSim

AirTrafficSim is a web-based air traffic simulation software written in Python and javascript. It is designed to visualize historical and research data, perform microscopic studies of air traffic movement with the integration of a historical weather database, and evaluate the performance of ATM algorithms.

## Features

- Replay histortic flights given data (FlightRadar 24 and simulated flights)
- Air traffic simulation using [BADA performance data](https://www.eurocontrol.int/model/bada)
- Navigation data simulation and visualization from [x-plane 11](https://developer.x-plane.com/docs/data-development-documentation/)
- Autopilot and Flight Management System simulation
- ATC traffic control methodology (Holding, vectoring, direct) simulation
- Weather data from [ECMWF ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview) and custom radar image
- Air traffic is controlled with API interface to simulate ATC interaction

## Installation

Conda environment is required to setup AirTrafficSim. All dependencies will be installated automatically and the client has been pre-built and is ready for use after download.

To download, enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/HKUST-OCTAD-LAB/AirTrafficSim.git
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After installation, please also download, unzip, and store BADA data in [data/performance/BADA](data/performance/BADA/). In addition follow [this guide](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to) to setup the API key for the weather database from ECMWF Climate Data Store.


## Running AirTrafficSim

You can run AirTrafficSim by executing the following commands. It uses port 6111 for communicaiton. Please open or forward the port accordingly if needed.

```
cd AirTrafficSim
conda activate airtrafficsim
python -m airtrafficsim
```

You should be able to open the UI using any modern browser at http://localhost:6111.


You can also run AirTrafficSim without the UI by providing the name of an environment which is listed in [environment](environment/). The environment name should be identical to the file name.

```
cd AirTrafficSim
conda activate airtrafficsim
python -m airtrafficsim --headless <environment name>
```
